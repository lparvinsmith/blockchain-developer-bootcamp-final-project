# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

Final project for Consensus Blockchain Bootcamp

## Retroactive Public Goods Funding

This project provides a template for communities to come together, establish a common problem, and establish incentives for entrepreneurs to solve the problem.

Inspired by Vitalik Buterin's talk: "Things that matter outside of defi" ([Link](https://github.com/lparvinsmith/blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project), July 21, 2021)

### Why Retroactive Funding

For a large group of people, retrospective decisions are easier than prospective decisions. This allows a large group to agree only on a shared problem, but does not require agreeing on the best solution until after the fact.

## The DAO, or the Community

The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is the contract that establishes the problem and formalizes the community members with voting power. During the formation of the DAO, members will contribute fees and receive voting power proportional to the amount they contribute. At the end of a specified term, the DAO members will vote on which project(s) were the most valuable, and buy up the project tokens.

## The Tokens, or the Incentive

Project tokens will be distributed to contributors and investors in a discrete project. This dapp will allow an entrepreneur to start a project, create project tokens, and raise funds by selling the tokens.
